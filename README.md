# Breast-Cancer-Classifier
This project is a binary classifier that predicts whether a breast tumor is **malignant** or **benign** using a feedforward neural network built from scratch with **PyTorch**.

---

## Dataset

- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository  
- **Name**: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)  
- **Samples**: 569  
- **Classes**: Benign (B) and Malignant (M)  
- **Features**: 30 real-valued attributes (mean radius, texture, etc.)

Balanced manually to 200 samples from each class.

##  Model Architecture

- Fully Connected Feedforward Neural Network
- Built using `torch.nn.Linear`
- Trained with Binary Cross-Entropy Loss

---

##  Results

- Accuracy: 96.25%
